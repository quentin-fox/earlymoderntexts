<h2>What Format Are the Texts In?</h2>
<p>All texts are available in PDF form. The downloadable files are linked in brackets next to the full-text or segment title.</p>

<p>Selected texts are available as <a href="http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/audio">audio books</a>. These files are also downloadable.</p>

<p>Starting March, 2019, we have begun digitizing all works into the e-book formats of epub (e-readers, tablets, cell phones) and Mobi (for Kindle).  These files are also downloadable. Epub and Mobi files will generally not be broken into segments.</P>
