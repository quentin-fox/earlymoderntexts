 <P>You may download and save the texts to your computer&rsquo;s hard disk, and may print them for your own use or for copying and distributing to a class. (Feel free to copy the ones you want for a given course and make them up into a bound book or packet to be given out to your class.) This applies to the complete texts, to the text-portions offered on the website, or any other text-portions that suit your purposes.</P>
<P> You may put texts onto any website where it is convenient for you to have them. But if you plan to do this so as to have texts available to your students, consider whether you have a good enough reason to do this rather than giving your students a link to www.earlymoderntexts.com.</P>
<P> If you are distributing hard copies or putting a text onto some other website, PLEASE ensure that your product includes a reference to www.earlymoderntexts.com as the source of the text.</P>
 <P>Permission is not <B>and will not be</B> given for the texts to be put to any commercial use. </P>
 <P> Charging students enough to cover the cost of copies supplied to them does not count as commercial use. Nor does including texts in a course reader to be sold to the students by a college book-store.</P>
<P> Links to this website may of course be placed anywhere.</P>

<P>In preparing material of which your class will get only hard copies, modify the texts in any way you like, including putting them into other formats such as MS Word. But please ensure that the copies include the copyright line, the various editorial devices, and the explanation of them. </P>
