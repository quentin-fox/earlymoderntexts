<h2>Grammatical Mistake</h2>
<p>Here is a typical instance of the grammatical error. Edwards wrote:</p>
<p>(1) Arminian liberty of will consists in the will&rsquo;s determining its own acts . . .</p>
<p>and his error-rich editor (ERE for short) changed this to</p>
<p>(2) Arminian liberty of will consists in the will determining its own acts . . .</p>
<p>This is now sanctioned by the Oxford University Press, one of whose editors introduced it throughout a book of mine a few years ago, forcing me to go through the whole typescript cleansing it. But it is an error. What it produces is a mistake, wrong, ungrammatical, indefensible.</p>
<p>Here are two reasons for saying this.</p>
<p><b>First reason:</b> The error turns something that can be grammatically explained or analysed into something that cannot. (1) says that Arminian liberty consists in an act of self-determination. Whose act? The will&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Nothing corresponding to this can be done for (2). The word-sequence &lsquo;the will determining its own acts . . .&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t a recognisable grammatical entity.</p>
<p>Another example of the error:- Edwards&rsquo;s correct</p>
<p>(3) I would inquire whether the will&rsquo;s coming to a determination to do so isn&rsquo;t the same thing as the soul&rsquo;s coming to a choice to do so</p>
<p>was changed by his ERE to</p>
<p>(4) I would inquire whether the will coming to a determination to do so is not the same thing as the soul coming to a choice to do so.</p>
<p>There is no way of cleanly construing (4). Trying to move towards an understanding of it, one naturally thinks that it includes something of the form &lsquo;whether the will [blah blah] is not the same thing as the soul [blah blah]&rsquo;. But of course what is meant by (3) isn&rsquo;t about equating the will with the soul, but rather equating a certain will-event with a certain soul-event. (Perhaps that equation <i>entails</i> that the will is the soul; but that isn&rsquo;t what it <i>says</i>.)</p>
<p><b>Second reason:</b> In many instances, everyone shrinks from the error, feeling that the possessive is required in the context of &lsquo;-ing&rsquo;. To avoid it in those cases while implementing it in others is to strike a further blow against the rule-guidedness (and thus the ultimate intelligibility) of our language. That wouldn&rsquo;t be so if there were a clean line around the cases where the error feels wrong even to error-makers, but there isn&rsquo;t. Very many of them involve possessive pronouns, including the following from the opening three pages of the error-mauled version of Edwards&rsquo;s book:</p>
<p>(5) The thing next chosen, or preferred, when a man wills to walk is not his being removed to such a place where he would be, but such an exertion and motion of his legs and feet. . . .</p>
<p>Had the ERE remained true to his error, he would have written &lsquo;is not him being removed&rsquo;, which would have sounded grotesque, even to him.</p>
<p>(6) And his willing such an alteration in his body in the present moment is nothing else but his choosing or preferring such an alteration in his body at such a moment, or his liking it better than the forbearance of it.</p>
<p>Fidelity to the error would require &lsquo;him willing&rsquo;, &lsquo;him choosing&rsquo; and &lsquo;him liking&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But it isn&rsquo;t only with pronouns that the ERE shrinks from his error. This is also from the abused version of Edwards:</p>
<p>(7) . . . or that a man&rsquo;s choosing, liking best, or being pleased with a thing, are not the same as his willing that thing.</p>
<p>Perhaps he left the possessive &ldquo;man&rsquo;s&rdquo; untouched here because if you change that to &ldquo;man&rdquo;, you get &ldquo;. . . a man choosing, liking best, or being pleased with a thing, are not the same as . . .&rdquo;, and the singular &ldquo;man&rdquo; clashes with the plural &ldquo;are&rdquo;. Just so; what is being talked about is not a man blah blah, but a choosing, a liking best, a being pleased with - three items. Whose choosing etc.? A man&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But in the very next sentence, though the ERE still suspends the error for the pronoun, he returns to it for the noun:</p>
<p>(8) Thus an act of the will is commonly expressed by its pleasing a man to do thus or thus; and a man doing as he wills and doing as he pleases are in common speech the same thing.</p>
<p>The very same noun, and another case of singular/plural trouble; perhaps the difference the ERE felt between these comes from there being three items in (7) but only two in (8), which is less plural!</p>
<p>This is chaotic: the ERE was steering by vague, unexamined intuitions that had nothing principled behind them. The obviously best way out of the chaos is to restore the possessive in every instance.</p>
